## What is Covara?

Covara spawned out of clearly identifying the bottleneck in human lawyers and risk analysts reading verbose and legalese-ridden commercial insurance policies and set out to build an engine that encodes domain expertise of seasoned lawyers and risk consultants supercharged with state-of-the-art OCR and agentic workflows with LLMs.

Our platform transforms the traditionally time-consuming process of policy review into an efficient, accurate, and accessible experience - enabling professionals to focus on strategic decision-making rather than document parsing.
